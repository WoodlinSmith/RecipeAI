Here is the initial release of the tank platform for Spring 2019 - CSC 340.

Quick Start:
% make

This will build all the *AI*.cpp files in the src/ directory.  These should
serve as some examples of how the platform API will behave.  Once the tanks
are built, you can pit them against one another in the game by modifying the
config.ini and map.txt files.

The config.ini file contains a number of configurable fields like which tank
to load, which image to use for tanks, projectiles, and map elements.

The map.txt file allows you to configure the obstacles and other features on
the playfield map as well as the dimensions of the map and starting locations
of the tanks.
